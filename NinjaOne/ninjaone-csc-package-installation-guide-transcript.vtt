So once you'll see all these four messages, start requested, started, and then once the installation is completed, you can see it as completed, and then you have to wait for the last message software added. So that's when the complete installation will be done, ok?

00:10:19.789 --> 00:10:36.689
So you see, Cisco Connect anyconnect, right? So the VPN has been installed. So likewise you can install all the other packages, but let's verify on the windows machine whether this package has been installed or not, right?

37 "Sunil Kumar Pabba" (941729792)
00:10:36.689 --> 00:10:54.959
